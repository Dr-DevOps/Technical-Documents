This guide assumes you're replicating from a primary region to the DR region (e.g., ap-southeast-1 to us-east-1).

## Setting Up Cross-Region Replication for DR

### 1. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

1. Open the Amazon ECR console in your primary region.

2. Select the repository you want to replicate (e.g., prod-be-core).

3. In the navigation pane, choose "Replication".

4. Click "Edit replication rules".

5. Choose "Add replication rule".

6. Configure the replication rule:
   - Destination Region: Select your DR region (e.g., us-east-1)
   - Destination Account ID: Enter your AWS account ID (leave blank if same account)

7. Click "Save" to create the replication rule.

8. Verify replication:
   - Switch to the DR region in the ECR console
   - Confirm that the repository exists and images are being replicated

Hereâ€™s the updated guidance incorporating both AWS Backup and Amazon RDS read replicas:

### **2. AWS Backup**

To configure AWS Backup for your RDS instances:

1. **Open the AWS Backup Console:**
   - Navigate to the AWS Backup console in your primary region.

2. **Create a Backup Plan:**
   - Go to "Backup plans" and click "Create backup plan".
   - Choose a predefined plan or create a custom plan.

3. **Configure Backup Plan:**
   - **Name:** Give your backup plan a name.
   - **Backup Vault:** Choose an existing backup vault or create a new one.
   - **Backup Frequency:** Set the backup schedule and retention policy.
   - **Backup Window:** Define the time window for backups.

4. **Assign Resources:**
   - Go to "Assign resources" and select the resources you want to back up.
   - For RDS, select the DB instances you want to include.

5. **Configure Backup Options:**
   - Choose any additional backup options, such as lifecycle policies.

6. **Review and Create:**
   - Review your backup plan settings and click "Create backup plan".

7. **Monitor Backups:**
   - Check the backup status and history in the AWS Backup console.

### **2.1 Amazon RDS Read Replicas**

To set up read replicas in a disaster recovery (DR) region:

1. **Open the Amazon RDS Console:**
   - Navigate to the Amazon RDS console in your primary region.

2. **Select Your Source DB Instance:**
   - Choose the DB instance you want to replicate.

3. **Create Read Replica:**
   - Choose "Actions" > "Create read replica".

4. **Configure the Read Replica:**
   - **Destination Region:** Select your DR region.
   - **DB Instance Identifier:** Provide a name (e.g., "drs-prod-db-replica").
   - **DB Instance Class:** Choose the appropriate size for DR.
   - **Multi-AZ Deployment:** Enable for high availability.
   - **VPC:** Select the VPC in your DR region.

5. **Configure Advanced Settings:**
   - Adjust settings for storage, backup retention, maintenance, etc.

6. **Create Read Replica:**
   - Click "Create read replica".

7. **Monitor Creation:**
   - Track the progress in the DR region's RDS console.

8. **Promote Read Replica:**
   - In the event of a disaster, promote the read replica to a standalone DB instance as needed.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Testing:** Regularly test your backups and read replicas to ensure they work as expected during a disaster recovery scenario.

### 3. AWS Secrets Manager

1. Open the AWS Secrets Manager console in your primary region.

2. Select the secret you want to replicate.

3. Choose "Actions" > "Edit".

4. Scroll to the "Replication" section.

5. Click "Add replica".

6. Choose your DR region from the dropdown.

7. Click "Save" to start replication.

8. Repeat for all secrets that need replication.

9. Verify in the DR region:
   - Switch to the DR region in the Secrets Manager console
   - Confirm that replicated secrets are present and up-to-date

### 4. Amazon S3

1. Open the Amazon S3 console.

2. Select the source bucket in your primary region.

3. Go to the "Management" tab.

4. Scroll to "Replication rules" and click "Create replication rule".

5. Configure the replication rule:
   - Rule name: Give it a descriptive name
   - Status: Enable
   - Source bucket: 
     - Choose "Entire bucket"
   - Destination: 
     - Choose "Buckets in this account"
     - Select the destination bucket in your DR region (create one if it doesn't exist)
   - IAM role: 
     - Create a new role or choose an existing one with necessary permissions

6. (Optional) Configure additional options like storage class, encryption, etc.

7. Review and click "Save" to create the replication rule.

8. Verify replication:
   - Check the destination bucket in the DR region
   - Confirm that objects are being replicated

### Additional Steps for DR Setup

1. Update your application configurations:
   - Modify your Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests in the `drs-prod-vi` directory to use the replicated resources in the DR region.

2. IAM Roles and Permissions:
   - Ensure that necessary IAM roles in the DR region have permissions to access the replicated resources.

3. Testing:
   - Regularly test accessing these replicated resources from your DR environment to ensure everything is set up correctly.

4. Monitoring:
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor the replication status for each service.

5. Documentation:
   - Keep detailed documentation of all replicated resources, including their ARNs and endpoints in the DR region.

6. Failover Process:
   - Develop and document a clear process for failing over to these replicated resources in a DR scenario.

7. Regular Reviews:
   - Periodically review and update your replication settings to ensure they still meet your DR requirements.

By following these steps, you'll have set up cross-region replication for ECR, RDS, Secrets Manager, and S3, creating a robust foundation for your Disaster Recovery environment. Remember to regularly test and update your DR processes to ensure they remain effective and aligned with your business needs.
